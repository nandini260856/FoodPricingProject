# RealTime-Food-Pricing-Tracker-with-Kafka-AWS

## Project Overview

This project implements a real-time food pricing data pipeline that ingests, processes, and analyzes pricing and availability data across various retailers using:

- **Kafka** for real-time data streaming
- **AWS S3** for scalable storage
- **AWS Glue** for ETL processing
- **AWS Athena** for SQL-based querying and analytics

The pipeline is designed to handle high data volumes with minimal latency, ensuring timely updates on food pricing and availability.

## Architecture Workflow

### System Components

1. **Data Ingestion - Kafka Producer**
   - A Python-based script reads food pricing data from online sources.
   - The Kafka producer publishes this data in real-time to a Kafka topic.

2. **Data Storage - AWS S3**
   - Incoming data from Kafka is stored in AWS S3, structured and partitioned by date and product ID for optimized access.

3. **Data Processing - AWS Glue & AWS Glue Data Catalog**
   - AWS Glue jobs transform raw data into a cleaned, structured format registered in the Glue Data Catalog for querying.

### Security & Permissions

- **IAM Roles** ensure secure access to AWS services, segregating duties and minimizing permissions to what's necessary.

## Solution Highlights

- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Utilizes Kafka and AWS services to process food pricing data efficiently.
- **Scalable Storage with AWS S3**: Ensures that data is accessible and secure.
- **Quick Data Access**: AWS Athena allows for fast retrieval and analysis of processed data.
- **Secure and Compliant**: Adheres to best practices in security and data compliance.

## Extensibility

This solution can be expanded to include more data sources or integrated with predictive analytics models to forecast pricing trends.
